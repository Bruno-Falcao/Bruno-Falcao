 <summary><h3>:man_technologist: Bruno's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 Hey everyone, let me tell you about my amazing coding journey! It all started back in 2018 when I was studying Information Systems. That's when I had my first taste of coding, and let me tell you, it was love at first sight. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into the world of technology and programming.

Fast forward a few years, and here I am, a proud software developer! That's right, I started working in 2021, and it's been an incredible experience so far. I've learned so much, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface of what's possible in this field.

But what really drives me is my passion for learning. Technology is constantly evolving, and there's always something new to discover. I love staying up to date with the latest trends and advancements, and I'm constantly pushing myself to learn more.

Coding isn't just a job for me, it's a lifestyle. I love the problem-solving aspect of it, and the feeling of accomplishment when I finally crack a tough challenge. And let's not forget the satisfaction of seeing my code come to life and actually making a difference in the world.

So, there you have it, my coding journey in a nutshell. It's been an exciting ride so far, and I can't wait to see where it takes me next. Whether it's building the next big app or contributing to groundbreaking research, I'm ready for whatever the future holds.
